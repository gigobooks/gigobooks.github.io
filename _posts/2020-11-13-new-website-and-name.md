title: "New website and name: Gig'o'Books"
---

Some announcements.

I've changed/updated/re-done this website. I reckon the new one looks better than the old one and is much more suited.

I'm also changing the name from `GigoBooks` to `Gig'o'Books`.<!--break--> I'm not really a fan of `GigoBooks` but it was a useful stop-gap whilst I was working on more urgent things. It served it's purpose but now I want something a bit more meaningful.

The new name `Gig'o'Books` is a play on 'gig' and 'books'. Sort of like ... Accounting for your gigs (all of them). When you're a solopreneur, consultant, contractor, freelancer etc., everything is a gig, and Gig'o'Books can account for them all.

And ... I've also created/added a logo and a privacy policy.

Thanks for reading!
