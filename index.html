  <p>
    If you have a gig (or several gigs!) or other source of side income and you need to do some simple accounting, tax reporting or invoicing, then Gig'o'Books is for you.
  </p><p>
    <strong>Gig'o'Books</strong> is an accounting app tailored for simple income-generating activities. All you have to do is enter sales and purchases data and Gig'o'Books will manage the accounts for you. It can also <strong>generate financial reports</strong>, help <strong>prepare your tax reports</strong>, and <strong>create invoices</strong>.
  </p><p>
    It's not worth spending hundreds of dollars to buy full-featured accounting software just for your simple gig. Nor do you want to be paying money every month just to record a few transactions (All those monthly charges add up!). In contrast, <strong>Gig'o'Books is free</strong>.
  </p><p>
    Best of all, your data stays on your own computer where it's <strong>safe and private</strong> instead of being stored in the cloud where who-knows-what algorithms are mining it for data.
  </p><p>
    Gig'o'Books is simple and easy to use. <strong>Spend as little time as possible</strong> on accounting, tax reporting or invoicing. The less time you spend, the better. Then go and <strong>do more important stuff</strong>.
  </p>

          Gig'o'Books comes in two (or maybe in the future, three) editions.
        </p><p>
          The Community / desktop edition (which is the original edition) runs on your Windows*/macOS/Linux desktop computer. It is free and open source.
        </p><p>
          The Community edition is traditional 'old style' desktop software and saves data files to the local computer.
        </p><p>
          The Web edition is the Community edition re-targeted to run in a web browser. It can run on any device (Windows/macOS/Linux/iPhone/Android) that has a modern web browser. It is free.
        </p><p>
          The Web edition also saves data files to the local computer.
        </p><p>
          In the future, we might:
        </p><ul>
          <li>
            Create a Premium edition for the desktop (or for smartphones) and charge for it, or
          </li><li>
            Put advertising on the Web edition.
          </li>
        </ul><p>
          However, these are speculative and might not even happen. (We're only mentioning them because some people insist on knowing our monetisation plan even though we don't know what it is yet.)

          Gig'o'Books is tailored at a niche and contains only features which are needed. It does not have all the features of full accounting software but that's actually a good thing. It means Gig'o'Books is simple and easy to use and it's not cluttered with unnecessary features.          
        </p><p>
          For example, there is no dedicated support for payroll or stock-keeping. (Albeit such data could still be entered via the generic double entry book-keeping feature.)

          Instead of running on a server 'somewhere in the cloud' like other SaaS accounting software, it runs fully (in a web browser) on your local computer or phone. Changes don't need to be uploaded to the cloud and then re-fetched. Rather, changes can appear instantaneously.

        The beautiful answer to this question is: There's no need to!

        Unlike other cloud-based or SaaS services, your file is not stored with us. Instead, it's stored on your own computer or phone.
      </p><p>
        Or if you save your file to a cloud folder by using something like Dropbox or Google Drive, it's saved to your own cloud, not ours. There's nothing for us to protect.

      <p>
        The Community desktop edition of Gig'o'Books runs on a computer (macOS/Linux, Windows soon) like a desktop software program.
      </p><p>
        The Web edition is a fork/variant of the Community edition that has been re-targeted to run inside a web browser. The source code changes are due to the vagaries of running in a web environment.
      </p><p>
        Functionally, there are no differences between the two editions. The features are exactly the same. Whatever you can do with one edition, you can also do with the other.

        The Web edition of Gig'o'Books is a progressive web app (PWA) that can be installed onto your computer or phone's home screen. Once installed, it can work offline.
      </p><p>
        This requires a web browser that supports PWAs. Most common web browsers already do.
      </p><p>
        To install as a PWA, start Gig'o'Books. Then, in your web browser's menu, there should be something that says <code>Install</code> or <code>Add to Home screen</code>. Click on that.
      </p><p>

        Nobody can predict the future. Large tech companies can falter. Long running tech products can get acquired and change their focus or even just be shut down.
      </p><p>
        Unfortunately, we can't guarantee we'll be around in 10 years time. We certainly intend to be, but we can't guarantee it. Nobody can guarantee anything.
      </p><p>
        However, here are some mitigating things to consider:
      </p><p>
        Gig'o'Books has extremely low, almost non-existent, running costs. The source code, website, and app are hosted by Microsoft on a free plan. Gig'o'Books is not going to have a problem with cash burn.
      </p><p>
        Gig'o'Books is focused on a niche. Once the product is feature complete, there is no pressure to keep 'innovating' if 'innovating' means 'continually changing things just so there is work to do'. Gig'o'Books is not going to change it's focus.
      </p><p>
        We use Gig'o'Books ourselves for our own personal projects. So we have a vested interest in it staying around.
      </p><p>
        Let's assume the worst case: Gig'o'Books is acquired for a billion dollars and forcibly shut down.
      </p><p>
        Since Gig'o'Books is open data, you'll still have your data and you can migrate to something else if you wish.
      </p><p>
        Since Gig'o'Books is open source, it can still be supported by the community and continue to keep working indefinitely.
      </p><p>
        Overall, Gig'o'Books is just as likely to still be around in 10 or 20 years time as any other app (if not more so).

        How can Gig'o'Books be free? What's your business model? How do you monetise?

    <div class="answer hs-target">
      <p>
        Gig'o'Books can be free because the running costs are almost non-existent. The source code, website, and app are hosted by Microsoft on a free plan. There are no expensive servers to maintain.
      </p><p>
        We don't really have a business model yet. We have some ideas, but they are just that: ideas. Ideas may or may not actually happen.
      </p><p>
        One idea is to sell a premium edition of Gig'o'Books and charge for it. But we don't really know what will be in the premium edition that is not in a 'non-premium' edition (Told you we don't have a business model yet).
      </p><p>
        In any case, if this happens, it will be far in the future. Furthermore, we won't remove any features in the existing editions in order to upsell.
      </p><p>
        Another idea is to place (non-targeted) advertising on the Web edition. This is just an idea, nothing more.

    <div class="answer hs-target">
      <p>
        When your gig or side income outgrows Gig'o'Books, you can export your data and pass it to your accountant or new accounting software provider. They can import it into your new system.
      </p><p>
        For example, you can open the data file with a sqlite database viewer and export in CSV format. (If you need a more customised or fancy export, please contact us.)
      </p><p>
        Since Gig'o'Books uses double entry book-keeping, there is no loss of data nor detail.

        What is Gig'o'Books unsuitable for?

    <div class="answer hs-target">
      <p>
        Gig'o'Books is unsuitable if:
      </p>
      <ul><li>
        You have employees or have to do payroll. &mdash; There's no support for either.
      </li><li>
        You have to keep track of inventory or stock. &mdash; There's no inventory or stock tracking feature. If you still want to use Gig'o'Books, you can, but you'd need to find another way to keep track of inventory or stock.
      </li><li>
        You have complicated financial affairs. &mdash; Unless you want to enter transactions as 'raw' double entry transactions.
      </li><li>
        More than one person works on the accounts at the same time.
      </li></ul>
      <p>
        To understand the last point, consider the following:
      </p>
      <ol><li>
        Alice opens a file with Gig'o'Books. 
      </li><li>
        Bob opens the same file with Gig'o'Books. (Let's assume the file is stored in a cloud folder. That's why two people can open it at the same time.)
      </li><li>
        Alice makes a change and saves the file.        
      </li><li>
        Bob makes a change and saves the file.
      </li></ol>
      <p>
        Oops! Bob overwrites Alice's change. Alice's change is lost.
