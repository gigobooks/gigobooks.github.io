          Gig'o'Books has true multi-currency support. You can enter transactions in any currency.
        </p><p>
          However, sales and purchases can only entered in a single currency (out of the currencies which are configured). For example, you can have an invoice that is in USD and another invoice which is in EUR, but you can't have an invoice which contains a USD amount and a EUR amount at the same time.
        </p><p>
          Reports can contain multiple currencies (where applicable), or can be configured to convert all amounts to a single currency (where applicable).

      Can I trust you with looking after my data? How do you protect my data?

    <div class="answer hs-target">
      <p>
        The beautiful answer to this question is: There's no need to!
      </p><p>
        Unlike other cloud-based or SaaS services, your file is not stored with us. Instead, it's stored on your own computer or phone.
      </p><p>
        Or if you save your file to a cloud folder by using something like Dropbox or Google Drive, it's saved to your own cloud, not ours. There's nothing for us to protect.
      </p>

  <div class="faq">
    {% include hs-checkbox.html id="cloud-storage-q" %}
    {% include hs-toggle.html id="cloud-storage-q" %}
    <span class="question">
      I want to store my file in the cloud. I want to use Gig'o'Books from any device. Can I do this?
    </span>

    <div class="answer hs-target">
      <p>
        Yes, you can!
      </p><p>
        Set up a cloud folder using something like Dropbox or Google Drive. Then, when you save your file, save it to the cloud folder.
      </p><p>
        Then, you can (use Gig'o'Books and) access the file from any device which has access to the folder.
      </p><p>
        (Speculation: In the future, we may consider having Gig'o'Books save directly to a user-provided cloud ie. Amazon S3.)
